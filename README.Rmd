# csra

`csra` is a package with functions used by [CSRA](https://social.hse.ru/mr/) staff to analyze political events. Now it has just few functions (one of them in the demo stage now - better say, in development stage), but it can be used for some basic analysis. Additionally, in near future some new features will be added, see news section. 

### Installation

You can install the development version of `csra` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vadvu/csra")

```
