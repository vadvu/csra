\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe}

\item{dep}{Character. Dependent variable.}

\item{ind}{Character. Independent variable.}

\item{cnt}{Vector of characters with names of control variables.}

\item{mod}{Character. Type of model (now just \code{brglm} is supported)}

\item{boot}{Character. Should middle point and "lines" be calculated via bootstrap? If no - "none", if yes - one can choose bootstrap type}

\item{factor}{Character. Only if \code{boot = T}.}

\item{n}{Number of bootstrap draws}

\item{HC}{Logical. Should heteroscedasticity-consistent SE be used?}

\item{const}{Logical. Should constant be included in the models?}

\item{table_remove}{Vector of variables names that should be excluded from the regression table.}

\item{plot}{Logical. Should plot be depicted?}

\item{tab_save}{Logical. Should table be saved? If yes - table is saved in working directory.}
}
\value{
Plot and regression table with u-shape test summary.
